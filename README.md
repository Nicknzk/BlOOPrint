## Aim:

We hope to make an **Entity Visualisation** mind map specially catered to Java Object-Oriented Programming to provide future programmers with an app to efficiently plan out and keep track of their implementations.

## Scope:

Simplified Entity Properties & Methods Viewing  

Automated Diagram Creation From Java File Upload 

User Account Authentication

## Problem:

Challenging to navigate between various tech stacks such as React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and Firebase while learning them simultaneously.

Styling an entire site from a blank slate

Difficult to determine the best online packages to incorporate in our project

Difficult to adjust CSS between inline CSS, MaterialUI, Bootstrap, and hosting on Vercel.

## User stories & Motivation:

Easy to lose track of the implementations when coding - As a student who is relatively new to programming, I want to be able to visualize and plan out the implementation of a given task/project

Searching through entities for methods & properties is tedious and time-consuming - As a student who is doing Object-Oriented Programming, I want to be able to more efficiently look up the necessary methods and properties

## Features implemented:

1\. User Account Authentication:

  - Securely authenticate user accounts with email verification.

  - Enforce strong password criteria to ensure account security.

2\. Interactive Walkthrough (bottom of landing page and sidebar):

  - Guided tour to help users quickly familiarize themselves with website usage.

3\. Manual Mind Map Creation:

  - Intuitively create mind maps with a user-friendly interface.

  - Edit and update mind maps as needed even after creation.

4\. Automatic Mind Map Creation:

  - Seamlessly upload JavaScript files of any format for automatic mind map generation.

  - Upload CSV files to instantly generate mind maps based on the provided data.

5\. Saving and Downloading Mind Map in CSV format:

  - Conveniently re-upload downloaded mind maps to the website for further updating.

  - Download mind maps in CSV format for offline viewing and easy sharing.

  - Optional: Download directly on the project page 

7\. Simplified Entity & Dependencies Viewing:

  - Easily visualize and explore entities and their dependencies in a simplified format.

  - Gain a clear understanding of the relationships between entities for efficient analysis and decision-making.

8\. Entity, Methods & Dependency viewing in Table format:

  - Convenient alternative method for viewing entity details on a single page.

## Testing Procedures:

- Usability testing with potential users with high-fidelity artifacts (e.g. working prototype)

- Survey of potential users

- System testing

- User testing
