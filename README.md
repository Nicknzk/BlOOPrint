Aim:
We hope to make a Entity Visualisation mind map specially catered to Java Object-Oriented Programming to provide future programmers an app to efficiently plan out and keep track of their implementations.

Scope:
Simplified Entity Properties & Methods Viewing  
Automated Diagram Creation From Java File Upload 
Automatic Code Documentation 
User Account Authentication

Problem:
Challenging to navigate between various tech stacks such as React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and Firebase while learning them simultaneously.
Styling an entire site from a blank slate
Difficult to determine the best online packages to incorporate in our project

What we achieved:
User Account Authentication
Basic skeleton and styling of the web app
Basic implementation of a back end using firebase
Basic navigation system with protected URLs

User stories & Motivation:
Easy to lose track of the implementations when coding - As a student who is relatively new to programming, I want to be able to visualise and plan out the implementation of a given task/project
Searching through entities for methods & properties is tedious and time-consuming - As a student who is doing Object-Oriented Programming, I want to be able to more efficiently look up the necessary methods and properties
Documenting code is annoying and tedious - As a student who does projects, documentation is a necessary yet neglected component of all projects.
