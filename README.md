Aim:
We hope to make a Entity Visualisation mind map specially catered to Java Object-Oriented Programming to provide future programmers an app to efficiently plan out and keep track of their implementations.

Scope:
Simplified Entity Properties & Methods Viewing  
Automated Diagram Creation From Java File Upload 
Automatic Code Documentation 
User Account Authentication

Problem:
Challenging to navigate between various tech stacks such as React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and Firebase while learning them simultaneously.
Styling an entire site from a blank slate
Difficult to determine the best online packages to incorporate in our project

What we achieved:
User Account Authentication
Basic skeleton and styling of the web app
Basic implementation of a back end using firebase
Basic navigation system with protected URLs

User stories & Motivation:
Easy to lose track of the implementations when coding - As a student who is relatively new to programming, I want to be able to visualise and plan out the implementation of a given task/project
Searching through entities for methods & properties is tedious and time-consuming - As a student who is doing Object-Oriented Programming, I want to be able to more efficiently look up the necessary methods and properties
Documenting code is annoying and tedious - As a student who does projects, documentation is a necessary yet neglected component of all projects.

Features implemented:

1. User Account Authentication:
- Securely authenticate user accounts with email verification.
- Enforce strong password criteria to ensure account security.
2. Interactive Walkthrough:
- Guided tour to help users quickly familiarize themselves with website usage.
3. Manual Mind Map Creation:
- Intuitively create mind maps with a user-friendly interface.
- Edit and update mind maps as needed even after creation.
4. Automatic Mind Map Creation:
- Seamlessly upload JavaScript files of any format for automatic mind map generation.
- Upload CSV files to instantly generate mind maps based on the provided data.
5. Download Mind Map in CSV Format:
- Download mind maps in CSV format for offline viewing and easy sharing.
- Conveniently re-upload downloaded mind maps to the website for further collaboration.
6. Simplified Entity & Dependencies Viewing:
- Easily visualize and explore entities and their dependencies in a simplified format.
- Gain a clear understanding of the relationships between entities for efficient analysis and decision-making.
